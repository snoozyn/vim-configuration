# VIMRC
My own .vimrc file.

# How to use:
* Clone this repository
* in your `.vimrc`, only have a line that says: `runtime vimrc` 
* in your `~./vim` folder you should copy my `vimrc` file and my `vim_ascii.txt` into this folder
* run `source %` in your `vimrc` as well as `:PlugInstall` to download the plugins
* make sure you have vim-plug installed on your machine 
# ASCII Art for Startup
Got from online, can download from this github and then use as your own. Make sure that you change the reference to that txt file.
